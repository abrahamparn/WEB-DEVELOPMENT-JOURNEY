# 🌐 Web Development Journey

Welcome to my **Web Development Journey** — a curated collection of frontend web development projects built as I advanced my skills through self-study, formal coursework, and hands-on challenges. Each project represents a different stage in my learning, from mastering the basics of HTML/CSS to building progressive web apps and implementing testing frameworks.

> 📚 This repository consolidates all my projects, experiments, and applications developed using modern frontend tools, based on real-world scenarios and guided curricula like Dicoding, FreeCodeCamp, and self-initiated tasks.
