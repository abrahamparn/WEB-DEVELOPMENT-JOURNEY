# 🎬 Netflix Landing Page Clone

This is a simple, responsive **Netflix landing page clone**, built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The layout and styling are inspired by Netflix's official homepage and was built as a frontend UI exercise based on a tutorial by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27JtRAI3QO8).

> 💡 This project focuses purely on frontend UI/UX structure and does not include backend functionality (e.g., login, database, etc.)
