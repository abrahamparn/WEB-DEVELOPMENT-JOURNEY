# 🛋️ LuxSpace Landing Page Clone

This project is a responsive, modern landing page built with **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, inspired by the LuxSpace furniture e-commerce site. It was created as part of the **BuildWithAngga (BWA)** front-end development course to practice modern component-based UI development.

> 🔧 Bootstrapped with Create React App (CRA) and styled with Tailwind for rapid UI building.
